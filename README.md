# mauricefreund.com

Welcome, Traveler! It seems like you came across the repository for my personal website.

I am not necessarily trying to get hired with this site but create a place where I can experiment with
different technologies and where I can showcase some of my projects.

Currently the site is in a, let's say, _minimalistic_ state. I'm hoping to find more time to add some cool stuff and, even more importantly, build some side projects to actually show on the site.

The current version is a static html site. Instead of writing CSS myself, I am using **TailwindCSS**, mainly because I wanted to know how it works and what it can do.

Feel free to look at the site and the code and take ideas that you like with you.

The site is hosted at mauricefreund.com
